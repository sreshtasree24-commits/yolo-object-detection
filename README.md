# YOLO Object Detection

This project is about detecting objects using the YOLO algorithm.  
The dataset was created using Roboflow, and the model was trained in Google Colab.

## Steps in the Project
1. Prepared dataset in Roboflow.
2. Imported YOLO model in Google Colab.
3. Trained the model with custom images.
4. Tested the model on new images.
5. Displayed detected objects with bounding boxes.

## Tools Used
- YOLO (You Only Look Once)
- Roboflow
- Google Colab
- Python

## Output
The model identifies objects in images and shows:
- Object name  
- Confidence score  
- Bounding box
